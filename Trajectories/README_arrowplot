This folder contains R code (arrow_plot.R) which generates arrow plots from the MIND data (PittData_20240213). The arrow plots can be used to examine the directionality of the populational neural dynamics. The MIND data was generated with an open source code from https://github.com/BrainCOGS/HPC_manifolds.git

The code (arrow_plot.R) begins by extracting the MIND data. Then, the angles of each arrow are calculated, which are the trajectories of the neural data at each time point in the lower dimension. 

Input: 
- PittData_20240213 - 7-dimensional embedding from the MIND algorithm
- Lever Press Timing from 1 example animal (within press_timing)

The output of this code includes 3 plots from the first 2 dimensions of the manifold: 
1. displays 3 different colors of dots: red, blue, light blue
    blue dots are the beginning of the specified time window for each trial
    red dots are the end of the specified time window for each trial
    light blue are all the timepoints within the specified time window for all lever presses
    arrows connect the dots from the beginning (blue) and end (red) of the specified time window
2. displays only the arrows from plot 1
3. displays a legend for plot 1 and 2 - the legend contains 4 arrows: 1 blue, 1 red, 2 black
    the blue arrow represents the average angle or main direction of all the trajectories
    the red arrow represents the opposite angle from the average angle
    the black arrows are the range +/-75 deg of the average angle
