The Standardizing_calcium_imaging.ipynb is a Python code to standardize the extracted raw calcium transients from CaImAn (Giovannucci et al. 2019; https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38173; https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn). 
This code requires Anaconda 3.0 and Windows 10 or greater to run. 

There are two standardization methods included in the code: z-score and deltaF/F 

The input for the Standardizing_calcium_imaging.ipynb is the 'example_neural_data.csv' which includes a time column and a column for each neuron and its activity.

Outputs from the Standardizing_calcium_imaging.ipynb code include two .csv files: one containing the z-score and the other containing the delta F/F data

These outputs (.csv files containing the z-score and delta F/F data) act as the starting points or the inputs for the other analysis codes.
