This Heatmap.R is a R code used to visualize neural activity and more specifically the z-score data around the timing of lever presses (behavior) and around baseline/random instances (no behavior/control). 

Specify your directory in the following variable: sampledir<-"specify your directory" (line 19)

You can run and visualize the data using different methods, which you can specify and change in line 27.
The different methods include kmean clustering and sorting the data by increasing, peak value, activity at -5s, -2.5s, 0s.
The inputs include an example .csv file containing the standardized data, the timing of lever presses, and the timing of inactive lever presses. 
The output includes heatmap visualizations based on the specified method in line 27.
