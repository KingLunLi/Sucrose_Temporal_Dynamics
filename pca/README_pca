There are two codes within this folder that are intended to be used one after the other:
1. Sample PCA code.ipynb - performs a linear dimensionality reduction method called principal component analysis (PCA). 
2. PCA_plot.R - reads PCA-transformed data, calculates and visualizes the differences between ALP and baseline samples, and aggregates results for further analysis

Sample PCA code.ipynb
The inputs: 
- CSV containing standardized data
- CSV containing lever press timing (behavior)
- CSV containing inactive lever press timing

The outputs: 
- After fitting, it extracts the PCA component from the pipeline and saves the explained variance ratios to a CSV file.
- The projected trials for each principal component are saved to separate CSV files based on their group (ALP, BL1, or BL2) and the iteration number. Each CSV file contains the projected data for a single principal component

Time to run this code depends on the amount of data you are trying to run PCA on

PCA_plot.R
